    <p>Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace</p>
    <p> As she slams the door in his drunken face</p>
    <p> And now he stands outside</p>
    <p> And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
    <p> He cries oh, girl you must be mad,</p>
    <p> What happened to the sweet love you and me had?</p>
    <p> Against the door he leans and starts a scene,</p>
    <p> And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>

    <p> And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually</p>

    <p> A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</p>
    <p> Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends</p>
    <p> And he built up a dream that when he grew up</p>
    <p>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Cheif</p>
    <blockquote> "Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
      Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first batle"</blockquote>
